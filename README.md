# EggCollector

A small project made in Cocos Creator. Component based

## Rules

Use arrows key to move your character. Characters can pick up eggs on the map (which will be spawned randomly) to gain scores. After a limited time, the character with the most score will win.

## Features

Implemented with a pseudo internal server. Has pseudo ping simulator: each request between client and server will be delayed in a range between 0 and 100ms. The server controls other players to update the client's state. Other players has decent AI to give some competitive feelings.
